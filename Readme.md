# Firefly Coordination

This is an assignment for my university (Birmingham).
The goal is to create a program that simulate Firefly Coordination.
The programming must be Cellular Automaton-like, but I don't really get the point for now.

The firefly class is working and everything is syncing.

Now I will start to write an interface with Swing or Processing.
